# Game Generation

General repo for experiments/learnings to work towards dynamic AI generated video games (holo-deck or bust)

# TODO
- Note: I don't plan on doing all these things in depth in this repository but I consider them to be preliminaries for AI generated games to be feasible  
- [X] MM-DiT for videos
- [ ] Latent video diffusion (SVD VAE?)  
- [X] V prediction for diffusion   
- [X] Smarter noise schedule  
- [X] Flow matching/rectified flows  
- [ ] Final frame inpainting  
- [ ] Adversarial diffusion distillation for video models  
- [ ] Temporal VAE training  
- [ ] Temporal VAE distillation  
- [ ] Control prediction  
- [ ] Control conditioned video generation
