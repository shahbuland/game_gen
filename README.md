# Game Generation

General repo for experiments/learnings to work towards dynamic AI generated video games (holo-deck or bust)

# TODO
- Note: I don't plan on doing all these things in depth in this repository but I consider them to be preliminaries for AI generated games to be feasible  
- [X] MM-DiT for videos
- [ ] Latent video diffusion (SVD VAE?)  
- [X] V prediction for diffusion   
- [X] Smarter noise schedule  
- [X] Flow matching/rectified flows  
- [ ] Final frame inpainting
- [ ] QKV caching for faster inpainting
- [X] Flash Attention
- [ ] Adversarial latent diffusion distillation for video models  
- [X] VAE training
- [X] Adversarial VAE decoding
- [X] VAE distillation
- [X] Video VAE
- [ ] Control prediction  
- [ ] Control conditioned video generation
